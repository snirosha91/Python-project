# Python-project

This project showcases a lane-detection algorithm fueled entirely by Computer Vision. Following are the steps involved in building this algorithm:

Step 1: Lane detection - image 
Step 2: Grayscale image
Step 3: Gaussian Blur
Step 4: Canny Edge Detection
Step 5: Region of Interest
Step 6: Bitwise_and
Step 7: Hough Transform
Step 8: Hough Transform 2
Step 9: Optimization
Step 10: Lane Detection - Video
